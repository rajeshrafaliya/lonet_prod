						While many strive to learn a language quickly, <strong style="font-size: 18px !important;">we recommend focusing on the process</strong> rather than the quick results. It is important to know that language fluency is a non-specific objective. With every new step, you feel the progress, but at the same time, you need to feel more fluent.</br></br>
						There is a big part of psychology in the learning process, which makes it very personal and individual. <strong style="font-size: 18px !important;">Everyone has their motivation, style of learning, challenges, and barriers. All of them influence your pace of learning.</strong></br></br>
						We recommend working with a personal language coach who will help you understand your unique strengths, strategies, and style of learning that fits you the best.¬†</br></br>
						Together with your language coach you will work out the best strategy and plan for you to learn a language in your record time.</br></br>

					<div class="content" style="display:none;">
						<p class="my-0">
							First, understand <strong style="font-size: 18px !important;">what is your goal</strong> in language learning. This will help you select the tutors <strong style="font-size: 18px !important;">who specialize in a specific area.</strong> For example, if your goal is to integrate into the target language society (you moved to a new country), then choose a language tutor or trainer who knows the cultural aspects of that language. They might be a native trainer or a tutor living in that country.</br></br>
							Second, read the description of the tutor's profile, reviews, and testimonials, and watch the introduction video. <strong style="font-size: 18px !important;">There should be a "click" :)))</strong> Trust your gut feeling and <strong style="font-size: 18px !important;">pay attention to what resonates with you,</strong> and which of them "clicks" with you. It is very important to choose a tutor who you like as a personality, and who you respect, understand, and trust. All these aspects are subjective and individual, and no one can give you a proper recommendation here. Listen to what people say, but more importantly, listen to yourself first.</br></br>

					It is very individual. Several factors influence your pace of language learning. They are:</br></br>
					- your previous experience and other language skills (if you are a multi-lingual already),¬†</br>
					- your motivation (your internal/intrinsic driver),¬†</br>
					- your availability (how much time you can dedicate),¬†</br>
					- your level of grit (how persistent and consistent you are),¬†</br>
					- your choice of material,¬†</br>
					- style of learning,¬†</br>
					- successful strategy¬†</br>
					- and support (a faithful language tutor and/or trainer or coach to support you).
					</br></br>
					In practice, it may take <strong style="font-size: 18px !important;">from 2 to 6 months to be able to converse</strong> in the language. <strong style="font-size: 18px !important;">From 6 months to 2 years start reading literature/books</strong> in the target language. <strong style="font-size: 18px !important;">From 1 year to 2 years to get to a stable B2 level (intermediate)</strong>, being able to speak, understand, and discuss general topics (from the weather and interests to news and technology).
					A lot depends on empowering support! To learn a language quickly, and efficiently and to enjoy the process, we recommend hiring a great language coach and/or tutor or trainer. They will help you <strong style="font-size: 18px !important;">set a SMART goal, work out a successful strategy and plan</strong>, and support you on the journey.</br></br>
